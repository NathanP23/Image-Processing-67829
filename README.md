# Image Processing (67829)

Exercises from the course [**"Image Processing (67829)"**](https://shnaton.huji.ac.il/index.php/NewSyl/67829/2/2026/) at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering**.

Taught by Prof. Shmuel Peleg; tutorials by Leeyam Gabay.

## Exercises
currently finished Ex1 - A Python implementation for detecting scene cuts in videos using histogram-based analysis with support for multiple distance metrics (L2, CORRELATION, CUMULATIVE).
The code is in the `/Ex1` folder.

## Syllabus

### Course/Module description:
Introduction to digital image processing: description of the imaging process, and learning basic concepts and operations.

### Course/Module aims:
To understand the capabilities of digital image processing, and enable students to develop and write basic software.

### Learning outcomes - On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
Students will be able to read image processing textbooks and papers, and implement basic algorithms. Also, design algorithms to solve many image processing problems.

### Attendance requirements(%):
2 points for attendance

### Course/Module Content:
Image capture and digitization; basics of imaging geometry; the Histogram; image enhancement and restoration; Convolutions and Fourier Transform; Intro to Sounds; Geometrical transformations and warping; Multiresolution pyramids; Image compression; Image alignment; panoramic stitching; Robust methods; morphology of binary images; neural network methods for image enhancement

### Additional information:
The prerequisite of "Algorithm" can be taken in parallel.
Assignments include substantial programming of image processing tasks. Programming will be in Python and its numerical libraries. Assignments will contribute 23% to the final grade. A passing grade in the assignment is needed for passing the course.

In order to complete the deep learning exercise, students will need a subscription to Colab Pro at a cost of $10/month (Price for September 2024). Needy students could apply for financial assistance.

3 short quizzes of 1 hour each will be given during the semester instead of a final exam. Each of these quizzes will contribute 25% of final grade, and MOED BET will not be given for quizzes.
